## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1pgneg19/Maltex.git
   cd Maltex
   ```

2. Generate the Xcode Project:
   Maltex uses `XcodeGen` to manage the project file. Do not commit `.xcodeproj` files if they are generated locally.
   ```bash
   xcodegen generate
   ```

3. Open the project:
   ```bash
   open Maltex.xcodeproj
   ```

### Coding Standards

- We use **Swift 6**.
- Follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (as configured in `project.yml`).
- Keep UI components small and reusable.

## Project Structure

- `Maltex/`: Main application source code.
- `MaltexExtension/`: Safari Web Extension source code.
- `extra/`: Bundled `aria2c` binaries and default configurations.
- `project.yml`: XcodeGen project specification.

## Translation

Maltex aims to be accessible to everyone. Translations are managed via `.xcstrings` files in the Xcode project. Contributions to localizations are highly appreciated!
