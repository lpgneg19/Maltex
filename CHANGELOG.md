# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Download History**: Fixed an issue where completed tasks could appear as duplicate entries in the history.

## [0.8.1.14] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Liquid Glass Design**: Refined the settings interface with proper corner radius and transparency to match Liquid Glass standards.
- **CI/CD Build**: Fixed an issue where system transparency effects were missing in builds distributed via GitHub Actions by adding Ad-hoc signing.
- **Safari Extension**: Fixed architecture thinning for the Safari Extension in the release workflow.
- **Release Notes**: Improved the automatic extraction of changelog notes in the release workflow for better accuracy.

## [0.8] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Liquid Glass Design**: Redesigned the entire application interface with a modern "Liquid Glass" (vibrancy/blur) aesthetic. This includes the sidebar, main content area, task details, and settings window.
- **Native Window Integration**: Enabled full-size content view and transparent title bars for a more integrated macOS experience.

### Changed
- **Engine Connection UX**: Removed the persistent "Connecting..." message during startup. The app now remains silent unless an engine error occurs.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Engine errors are now presented via native macOS alerts with retry options, reducing UI clutter.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Localization**: Added comprehensive Chinese localization support across the application, adhering to standard practices.
- **Download History**: Implemented local history persistence (`HistoryStore`). Completed or removed tasks are now archived and can be viewed even after restarting the app.
- **Torrent Preview**: Enhanced the torrent confirmation dialog with a file list preview. Users can now:
    - View individual file sizes.
    - Select/Deselect all files.
    - Choose specific files to download.
- **Task Categories**: Added "All Tasks" and "Paused" categories to the sidebar for better task management.
- **Clipboard Detection**: The "Add Task" view now automatically detects and populates magnet links or HTTP/HTTPS URLs from the clipboard.

### Changed
- **UI Improvements**: Updated task status colors to be more intuitive:
    - 🔵 Blue: Downloading
    - ⚪️ Gray: Paused
    - 🔴 Red: Error/Stopped
    - 🟢 Green: Completed
- **Task Deletion**: Improved task removal logic to ensure "zombie" tasks are completely removed from both the engine and the UI.
- **File Association**: Added support for opening `.torrent` files and handling `magnet:` links directly within the app.

## [0.6] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **Startup Crash**: Fixed a crash caused by notification permission request callback being executed on a background thread, violating Main Actor isolation.

### Changed
- **Version Update**: Bumped version to 0.6.

## [0.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Engine Connection Failure**: Resolved a critical issue where the Aria2 engine would fail to start or connect due to spaces in the macOS "Application Support" directory path.
- **App Crash during Logging**: Fixed a crash caused by concurrent write access to the same log file by both the Swift app and the Aria2 process.
- **Engine Startup Loop**: Fixed an issue where the engine would exit with code 28 when trying to load an empty or corrupted input file.
- **IPv6 Binding Conflicts**: Added `--disable-ipv6=true` to prevent the engine from failing to bind to ports on certain network configurations.

### Changed
- **Data Directory**: Migrated user data and engine logs to `~/Library/Application Support/Motrix` and optimized argument handling for paths with spaces.
- **Logging Architecture**: Separated application logs (`motrix.log`) from engine logs (`aria2.log`) and added a dedicated `aria2_stderr.log` for capturing runtime errors.
- **RPC Host**: Switched default RPC connection host from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost` to improve compatibility with local loopback interfaces.
- **Engine Arguments**: Simplified `aria2c` startup flags to increase reliability across different macOS environments.
